# Code Crack Repository

This repository is all about my personal solutions to problems I've encountered during past coding interviews and certification challenges

Many of these were problems I initially struggled with or even failed - so I made it a goal to revisit and solve them properly.

I hope it helps others who are on a similar journey.
