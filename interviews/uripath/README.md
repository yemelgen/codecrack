# URI Parser

This challenge came from an interview where I was asked to implement a URI parser in C++ with a twist:
I also had to correctly handle local file paths (e.g. /home/use/file.txt) in addition to standard URIs.

At the time, I didn't know  C++ well enough to implement something like this without relying heavily on external resources.

So, I decided to take a different route and implement the parser entirely in C, a language I was more comfortable with.

While I didn't pass the interview, this ended up being a valuable learning experience.
